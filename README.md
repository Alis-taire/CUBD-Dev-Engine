# CUBD Dev Engine

CUBD Dev Engine, or CDE is a small, yet powerful ROBLOX game engine that will setup-- or give you the source to setup the basis of your game faster! This is a personal project, as I'm currently the only developer for CUBD Dev, so don't expect too much, but I do plan on having at least a MMORPG Engine, Murder-Type Game Engine, and.. A Role-Playing Engine.

# More Information
The MMORPG Engine will be the first I'm going to work on, as it is the easiest. It basically setups your MMORPG for you, code-wise. You can always contact me for help and things of the such! I plan for it to include a.. easy-to-use Data saving utility ( DataStores ftw! ), weapon scripts, NPC scripts, and best of all, magic!
